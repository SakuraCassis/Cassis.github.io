### Finite Fields

> **Def**: [Characteristic]
> Let $K$ be a field. The image of $\mathbf{Z}$ in $K$ is an integral domain, hence isomorphic to $\mathbf{Z}$ or to $\mathbf{Z} / p \mathbf{Z},$ where $p$ is prime; 
> Its field of fractions is isomorphic to $\mathbf{Q}$ or to $\mathbf{Z} / p \mathbf{Z}=\mathbf{F}_{p}$. In the first case, one says that $K$ is of characteristic zero; in the second case, that $K$ is of characteristic $p$ .

The characteristic of $K$ is denoted by $\operatorname{char}(K) .$ If $\operatorname{char}(K)=p \neq 0, p$ is also the smallest integer $n>0$ such that $n\cdot1=0$ .

> **Lemma**: If $\operatorname{char}(K)=p,$ the map $\sigma : x \mapsto x^{p}$ is an isomorphism of $K$ onto one of its subfields $K^{p}$ .

> **Theorem** 1 :
>
> i) The characteristic of a finite field $K$ is a prime number $p \neq 0 ;$ if $f=\left[K : \mathbf{F}_{p}\right],$ the number of elements of $K$ is $q=p^{f}$ . 
>
> ii) Let $p$ be a prime number and let $q=p^{f}(f \geqslant 1)$ be a power of $p .$ Let $\Omega$  be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p. There exists a unique subfield $\mathbf{F}_{q}$ of $\Omega$ which has $q$ elements. It is the set of roots of the polynomial $X^{q}-X .$ 
>
> iii) All finite fields with $q=p^{f}$ elements are isomorphic to $\mathbf{F}_{\boldsymbol{q}}$

### The multiplicative group of a finite field

> **Theorem** 2: The multiplicative group $F^*_q$ of a finite field $F_q$ is cyclic of order $q-1$ .  

> **Lemma** $1 :$ If $n$ is an integer $\geqslant 1,$ then $n=\sum_{d | n} \phi(d)$

> **Lemma** $2 :$ Let $H$ be a finite group of order $n$ . Suppose that, for all divisors d of $n,$ the set of $x \in H$ such that $x^{d}=1$ has at most $d$ elements. Then $H$ is cyclic.

### Legendre symbol

> **Definition**: Let $p$ be a prime number $\neq 2,$ and let $x \in \mathbf{F}_{p}^{*} .$ The Legendre symbol of $x,$ denoted by $\left(\frac{x}{p}\right),$ is the integer $x^{(p-1) / 2}=\pm 1 .$



### Quadratic reciprocity law

> **Theorem** 6 (Gauss). $\left(\frac{l}{p}\right)=\left(\frac{p}{l}\right) (-1)^{\varepsilon(l) \varepsilon(p)}$
